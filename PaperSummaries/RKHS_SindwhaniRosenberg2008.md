## 1 Introduction
In semi-supervised learning, want to estimate a target function from a few labeled samples and many unlabeled. Suppose there are two hypothesis spaces, H1 and H2, and each contain a predictor that well-approximates the target function. "*Predictors that agree with the target function also agree with each other on unlabeled examples.*"
